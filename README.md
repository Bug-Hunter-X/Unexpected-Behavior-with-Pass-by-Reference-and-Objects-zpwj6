This example demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to pass-by-reference and objects.  The `processArray` function intends to increment values within an array. While it works correctly for numeric arrays, attempting to increment objects directly causes an error because objects cannot be incremented directly using the ++ operator. The solution involves modifying the function to handle object increment differently or by not using increment operator at all.
